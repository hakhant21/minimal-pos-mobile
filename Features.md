> **Status:** Implemented
### Stock In (Add Stock)

### Cost Price Tracking
- When a sale is completed, the variant's current cost price is snapshotted to `sale_items.cost_price`
- Future stock additions that change the weighted average cost price do not affect historical COGS
- Profit/Loss reports use the snapshotted `sale_items.cost_price`, falling back to the variant's current cost price if missing (backwards compatibility)

## 11. Data Relationships

```
Category (1) ──── (N) Product (1) ──── (N) ProductVariant (N) ──── (1) Unit
                              ProductVariant (1) ──── (N) SaleItem (N) ──── (1) Sale
```

- **Cost Price:** stored on `product_variants.cost_price` (current weighted average) and snapshotted to `sale_items.cost_price` at sale time
- **Sell Price:** stored on `product_variants.selling_price` and copied to `sale_items.unit_price` at time of sale
- **Profit/Loss:** calculated in reports as `SUM(sale_items.total_price) - SUM(sale_items.quantity * sale_items.cost_price)`, falling back to `product_variants.cost_price` if snapshot is missing
- **Stock Status:** computed attribute on ProductVariant based on `stock_quantity` vs `min_stock_level` thresholds
